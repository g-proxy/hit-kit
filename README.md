# hit-kit

Hit-Kit is a set of tools to provide random internet wide target selection for further
detailed examination.

The tool set can be started from control.sh

It is designed to be a slow long running scanner that filters out ports and services of
interest to provide some low hanging fruit.

Enjoy,
